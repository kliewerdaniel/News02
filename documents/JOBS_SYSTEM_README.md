## How to Use

### 1. Create RSS Profiles
Before scheduling jobs, create RSS profiles:

1. Go to **RSS Feeds** page (`/feeds`)
2. Add your desired RSS feed URLs
3. Click **"Manage Profiles"** button
4. Save current feeds as a named profile
5. Repeat for different feed collections (e.g., "Tech News", "World Events")

### 2. Schedule a Job

1. Navigate to **Jobs** page (`/jobs`)
2. Fill out the job form:
   - **Job Name**: Descriptive name (e.g., "Morning Tech News")
   - **Schedule Time**: Use 24-hour format (e.g., 07:30)
   - **RSS Profile**: Select from your saved profiles
   - **Articles per Feed**: Choose how many articles per RSS feed
   - **Models**: Select summary and broadcast generation models
   - **Recurrence**: Choose frequency
3. Click **"Schedule Job"**

### 3. Monitor Jobs

#### Job List
- View all scheduled jobs with status indicators
- Green play icon = enabled
- Yellow pause icon = disabled
- See next run time and last execution

#### Job Actions
- **üëÅ View**: See detailed job configuration and execution history
- **‚è∏ Pause/‚ñ∂ Play**: Enable/disable job
- **‚ñ∂ Run Now**: Execute immediately (added to queue)

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Scheduled jobs configuration
scheduled_jobs (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,           -- UUID
    name TEXT NOT NULL,            -- User-friendly name
    time TEXT NOT NULL,            -- HH:MM format
    profile TEXT NOT NULL,         -- RSS profile name
    articles_per_feed INTEGER,     -- Articles per RSS feed
    summary_model TEXT,            -- LLM model for summaries
    broadcast_model TEXT,          -- LLM model for broadcast
    recurrence TEXT,               -- once|daily|weekdays|weekends
    enabled BOOLEAN,               -- Job active status
    created_at TIMESTAMP,          -- Job creation time
    last_run TIMESTAMP,            -- Last execution time
    next_run TIMESTAMP,            -- Next scheduled time
    run_count INTEGER,             -- Total executions
    success_count INTEGER,         -- Successful executions
    last_error TEXT,               -- Last error message
    last_output TEXT               -- Last output file path
);

-- Job execution history
job_executions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    job_id TEXT,                   -- Foreign key to scheduled_jobs
    started_at TIMESTAMP,          -- Execution start time
    completed_at TIMESTAMP,        -- Execution end time
    status TEXT,                   -- running|completed|failed
    error_message TEXT,            -- Error details if failed
    output_file TEXT,              -- Generated markdown file
    audio_file TEXT,               -- Generated audio file
    article_count INTEGER          -- Articles processed
);
```

### Job Execution Flow
1. **Scheduler Loop**: Checks for due jobs every 30 seconds
2. **Queue Management**: Immediate jobs and scheduled jobs share a queue
3. **Profile Loading**: Loads RSS feeds from selected profile
4. **Environment Setup**: Sets model and article count preferences
5. **Article Processing**: Fetches ‚Üí Summarizes ‚Üí Broadcasts ‚Üí Saves
6. **File Generation**: Creates markdown digest and MP3 audio
7. **Status Updates**: Records execution results and schedules next run

### File Naming Convention
Generated files use job names for organization:
- **Markdown**: `{JobName}_{timestamp}.md`
- **Audio**: `{JobName}_{timestamp}.mp3`
- **Default**: `digest_{timestamp}.md` (manual generation)

### Conflict Resolution
- **Single Execution**: Only one job runs at a time
- **Queue System**: Conflicting jobs wait in execution queue
- **Priority**: Manual "Run Now" jobs take priority over scheduled jobs
- **Error Handling**: Failed jobs don't block subsequent executions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Job Not Running**
- Check if job is enabled (green play icon)
- Verify RSS profile exists and has valid feeds
- Check system time matches expected execution time
- Review job execution history for errors

**No Articles Generated**
- RSS feeds may be down or changed URLs
- Database may show all articles as already processed
- Try "Reset Processed" in Settings to allow reprocessing
- Verify RSS profile contains working feed URLs

**Audio Generation Fails**
- Check TTS settings in main Settings page
- Verify edge-tts is properly installed
- Check output directory permissions

**Jobs Queue Not Moving**
- Check if a job is stuck in "running" state
- Restart the web application to reset execution status
- Review logs for detailed error messages

### Logs and Debugging
- Job execution logs appear in the application console
- Detailed error messages stored in job execution history
- Use "View Details" button to see full job configuration and history

## Security Notes

- Job execution uses same security context as manual generation
- RSS profiles stored in YAML files (not database) for portability
- No external job scheduling dependencies (self-contained)
- Jobs automatically disabled after single execution ("once" recurrence)

## Performance Considerations

- Jobs respect the same rate limiting as manual generation
- Multiple articles from same feed are processed sequentially
- Large RSS profiles may take longer to process
- Consider staggering job times to avoid resource conflicts

The Jobs System provides powerful automation while maintaining the flexibility and control of the manual digest generation process.
