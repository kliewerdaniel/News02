# 📰 AI News Digest Generator

This Python script automatically fetches news articles from RSS feeds, summarizes them using a local LLM (via Ollama), writes a coherent broadcast-style script, and generates a text-to-speech (TTS) audio file of the broadcast.

## ✨ Features

- Pulls articles from any RSS feed (configurable via `feeds.yaml`)
- Summarizes news using a local LLM (Ollama)
- Generates a flowing, anchor-style news script
- Converts the script into an MP3 audio broadcast using Microsoft Edge TTS
- Saves both text and audio versions with timestamped filenames

---

## 🔧 Configurable Models

You can easily modify which models or voices to use by changing these variables at the top of the script:

```python
# === CONFIGURABLE MODELS ===
SUMMARY_MODEL = 'mistral:latest'            # For summarizing articles
BROADCAST_MODEL = 'mistral-small:24b-instruct-2501-q8_0'  # For combining summaries into a narrative
TTS_VOICE = "en-US-GuyNeural"               # Microsoft Edge TTS voice
